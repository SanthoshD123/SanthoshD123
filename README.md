Just kidding. I build things that shouldn't work but somehow do.

**Current obsession:** Teaching machines to see  
**Previous obsession:** Data structures that don't hate me  
**Next obsession:** TBD

**Tech stack:** Python • Java • Whatever gets the job done  
**Philosophy:** Code first, ask questions while debugging
